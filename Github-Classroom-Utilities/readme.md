# GitHub Classroom Utilities by Christopher Cannon
Sourced from: https://github.com/ccannon94/github-classroom-utilties

This is a collection of scripts developed for use in administrating GitHub Classroom assignments. These scripts are under constant development. I will try and update this README with documentation once the scripts reach a robust working state.

## AddFile.py

Python 3 command line utility to add a file to the **master** branch of every repository in an assignment and push those repositories.

### Pre-state

There must exist a directory containing every repository for a given assignment and _only_ those repositories.

There must exist a file on user's local machine that is to be added to each repository.

### Usage

This utility requires 2 command line arguments:
1. The _absolute_ path to the directory containing each of your repositories.
2. The _absolute_ path to the file that needs to be added.

Example: `python3 addFile.py /Users/Username/Documents/COMP167/Program2-StudentRepos /Users/Username/Downloads/UpdatedAssignment.md`


## CloneAssignment.py

Python 3 command line utility to clone student repositories created using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com).

### Pre-state

There must exist a GitHub classroom assignment.

The user must have a plain text file (.txt or .csv) with the GitHub usernames of all students separated by new lines.

### Usage

This utility requires 3 command line arguments:
1. The name of the GitHub organization that hosts the classroom, as it appears in a GitHub URL. (i.e. My Code Classroom would be entered as my-code-classroom).
2. The assignment name as it appears in a GitHub URL. (Coding Assignment 1 would be coding-assignment-1).
3. The local path to the .csv or .txt file that holds GitHub usernames.

Example: `python3 CloneAssignment.py my-class-organization assignment-1-variables ~/Documents/classroster.txt`

## MossSetup.py

**NOTE: This script does not yet handle multiple branches in an assignment**

Python3 command line utility to clone all repositories from an assignment created using [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com) and prepare them for evaluation using [MOSS plagiarism detection](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/).

### MOSS Directory Structure

The goal of this script is to transfer source files from and IDE project structure to the required MOSS file structure.

```
| - solution_directory
  | - student1
    | - classA.java
    | - classB.java
    | - ...
  | - student2
    | - ...
  | - student3
    | - ...
  | - ...
```

### Pre-state

There must exist a GitHub classroom assignment.

The user must have a plain text file (.txt or .csv) with the GitHub usernames of all students separated by new lines.

There must exist an empty directory that will hold GitHub repositories and the MOSS directory structure.

The user must have the CloneAssignment.py script from this repository on their machine.

### Usage

This script requires 5 command line arguments:

1. The name of the GitHub organization that hosts the classroom, as it appears in a GitHub URL. (i.e. My Code Classroom would be entered as my-code-classroom).
2. The assignment name as it appears in a GitHub URL. (Coding Assignment 1 would be coding-assignment-1).
3. The local path to the .csv or .txt file that holds GitHub usernames.
4. The local path to the users copy of the CloneAssignment.py script.
5. The local path to an empty directory that will hold all program output.

Example: `python3 MossSetup.py my-class-organization assignment-1-variables ~/Documents/classroster.txt ~/Downloads/CloneAssignment.py ~/Desktop/MyAssignmentToEvaluate`
